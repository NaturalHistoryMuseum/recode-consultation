### [High level use cases](https://github.com/NaturalHistoryMuseum/recode-consultation/discussions?discussions_q=category%3A%22High+level+use+cases%22)
> Beyond core collections management activities, what are the broad use case themes relevant to your organisation that a new CMS would need to support? For example, some institutions have living collections, others have frozen tissue collections which integrate with other data systems and processes. We aim to capture these at a very high level, to ensure that the RECODE specification has the potential to address these in the future.

### [Data integrations](https://github.com/NaturalHistoryMuseum/recode-consultation/discussions?discussions_q=category%3A%22Data+integrations%22)
> Some data and concepts lend themselves to community curation and management. For example, taxonomy, stratigraphy, geospatial data, organisational identifiers and people identifiers, are concepts or data points that can be openly shared and where there are genuine efficiencies by opening these to community management outside the NHM. We seek to understand what these concepts are, what key systems hold these data, and assess these systems' readiness to integrate with a CMS.

### [System integrations](https://github.com/NaturalHistoryMuseum/recode-consultation/discussions?discussions_q=category%3A%22System+integrations%22)
> Huge effort has already been invested in CMS development across the sector. There are benefits to aligning system architectures and data standards to ensure compatibility and sustainable data exchange. We seek to understand what these systems are, what data standards are relevant, and examine the functionality of the APIs of these systems in order to assess their potential to facilitate future integrations.

### [Community governance](https://github.com/NaturalHistoryMuseum/recode-consultation/discussions?discussions_q=category%3A%22Community+governance%22)
> Our long term goal is to spread the management and development roadmap of a CMS with other institutions. What are the requirements around governance, funding and development that would build the level of trust necessary for peer institutions to engage more deeply with that roadmap?
